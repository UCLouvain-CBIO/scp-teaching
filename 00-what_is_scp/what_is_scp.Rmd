### What is scp?

- **scp** stands for *single cell proteomics*.

- **scp** is a piece of software to process, analyse and interpret
  mass spectrometry-based single cell protemics data.

- It is an R package: it is implemented in the R language for
  statistical computing and is operated through the R environment.

- It is part of the Bioconductor package: it is interoperable and thus
  benefits from numerous of software for the analysis of omics data,
  such as for example proteomcs of single cell transcriptomics.
