## How to

1. Create a new directory for each slide deck
2. Only track the sources files/content in that directory
3. Copy the final slides (html or pdf) into `docs`. For html slides,
   you probably also need the css file and figures (unless you use
   URLs in the Rmd).
4. Update the main `README.md` file with links to your slides.
5. Push your source files and content of `docs` to GitHub.
