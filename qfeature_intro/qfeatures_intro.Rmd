# What is QFeatures?

---

class: middle

### What is QFeatures?

- An R/[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/QFeatures)
  *package* to process and manage quantitative proteomics data.

- The *class*, i.e. the computational object that will hold the
  quantitative (single cell) proteomics data and that will take track
  of it during its processing.

# Feature aggregation in proteomics

---
class: middle

### Feature aggregation in proteomics

- One or more PSMs are aggregated into peptides.
- One or more peptides are aggregated into protein groups.

QFeatures does this in a consistent and reproducible way and records
these steps, so that one can easily track features across levels.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[QFeatures]

A **QFeatures** object containing three **assays**, named PSM1, PSM2
and PSM3. Each assay contains quantitative data for a set of features
(rows) and samples (columns). The **QFeatures** object also contains
sample annotations matching columns across all assays.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./figs/qfeatures_intro_1.svg')
```

Such a **QFeatures** object can be created with the [`readSCP()`]()
function.
