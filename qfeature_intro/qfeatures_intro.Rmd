# What is QFeatures?

---

class: middle

### What is QFeatures?

- An R/[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/QFeatures) package to process and manage quantitative
  proteomics data.

- The *class*, i.e. the computational object that will hold the
  quantitative (single cell) proteomics data and that will take track
  of it during its processing.

# Feature aggregation in proteomics

---
class: middle

### Feature aggregation in proteomics

- One or more PSMs are aggregated into peptides.
- One or more peptides are aggregated into protein groups.

QFeatures does this in a consistent and reproducible way and records
these steps, so that one can easily track features across levels.
