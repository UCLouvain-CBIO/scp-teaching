### What is scp?

- **scp** stands for *single cell proteomics*.

- **scp** is a piece of software to process, analyse and interpret
  mass spectrometry-based *single cell protemics* data.

- It is an [R](http://r-project.org) package - it is implemented in
  the R language for statistical computing and is operated through the
  R environment.

- It is part of
  [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/scp) - it is
  interoperable and thus benefits from numerous of software for the
  analysis of omics data, such as for example proteomcs of single cell
  transcriptomics.

### Is it like ... (insert your favourite software)?

No, **scp** will give you more flexibility than any other software and
functionality dedicated to mass spectrometry-based single cell
proteomics.

### Are there any alternatives to scp?

The closest to **scp** is the python-based `SCeptre` ([Schoof *et
al.*, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23667-y)),
although it isn't as advances as **scp**.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManacer")

BiocManager::install("scpdata")
BiocManager::install("scp")
```
